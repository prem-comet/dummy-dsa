    <h1> white house</h1>
    <p>The residence was designed by Irish-born <a style="text-decoration: underline;">architec</a> James Hoban in the Neoclassical style.[4] Hoban modeled the building on Leinster House in Dublin, a building which today houses the Oireachtas, the Irish legislature. Construction took place between 1792 and 1800, with an exterior of Aquia Creek sandstone painted white. When Thomas Jefferson moved into the house in 1801, he and architect Benjamin Henry Latrobe added low colonnades on each wing to conceal what then were stables and storage.[5] In 1814, during the War of 1812, 
        the mansion was set ablaze by British forces in the burning of Washington, destroying the interior 
        and charring much of the exterior. </p>

    <h2>Early history</h2>
    <p>Washington never lived at Government House since the national capital was moved to
         Philadelphia in 1790, where it remained through 1800.[9][10] The July 1790 Residence Act designated the capital be permanently located in the new Federal District, and temporarily in Philadelphia for ten years while the permanent capital was built.[11] Philadelphia rented the mansion of Robert Morris, a merchant, at 190 High Street, now 524â€“30 Market Street,
         as the President's House, which Washington occupied from November 1790 to March 1797</p>
